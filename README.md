## Problem Statement

In the world of cricket, analyzing player performance is often challenging due to the availability of raw statistics in scattered formats. While platforms like ESPN Cricinfo provide comprehensive data, the absence of interactive and visually engaging insights makes it difficult for fans, analysts, and coaches to quickly evaluate batting and bowling performance.

The challenge lies in:

Transforming large volumes of raw cricket statistics into meaningful insights.

Enabling player-wise analysis for comparing performance across different matches.

Showcasing key performance indicators (KPIs) like runs, strike rate, wickets, economy rate, etc., in an intuitive and interactive manner.

Enhancing storytelling with visuals and navigation to make cricket analytics more engaging and accessible.


This project addresses these challenges by building an interactive Power BI Dashboard that analyzes batting and bowling statistics of players in India vs Australia ODI matches. The dashboard leverages Cricinfo‚Äôs Statsguru data (imported directly from the web) and provides slicers, buttons, and KPI visuals to make performance tracking interactive, insightful, and user-friendly.
